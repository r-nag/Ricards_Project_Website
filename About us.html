          It's not uncommon to hear laughter, but there are extended periods of quiet as people become lost in their work. We rarely have meetings, so you'll be able
          to stay focused on whatever project you are working on at the moment. When someone has an issue or needs help, the entire team is there to offer guidance and
          give their perspective.
